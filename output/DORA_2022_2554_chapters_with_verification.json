For the purpose of assessing preparedness for handling ICT-related incidents, of identifying weaknesses, deficiencies\nand gaps in digital operational resilience, and of promptly implementing corrective measures, financial entities, other than\nmicroenterprises, shall, taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2), establish, maintain and review a sound and\ncomprehensive digital operational resilience testing programme as an integral part of the ICT risk-management framework\nreferred to in Article 6.\n2. The digital operational resilience testing programme shall include a range of assessments, tests, methodologies,\npractices and tools to be applied in accordance with Articles 25 and 26.\n3. When conducting the digital operational resilience testing programme referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article,\nfinancial entities, other than microenterprises, shall follow a risk-based approach taking into account the criteria set out in\nArticle 4(2) duly considering the evolving landscape of ICT risk, any specific risks to which the financial entity concerned is\nor might be exposed, the criticality of information assets and of services provided, as well as any other factor the financial\nentity deems appropriate.\n4. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure that tests are undertaken by independent parties, whether\ninternal or external. Where tests are undertaken by an internal tester, financial entities shall dedicate sufficient resources and\nensure that conflicts of interest are avoided throughout the design and execution phases of the test.\n5. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall establish procedures and policies to prioritise, classify and\nremedy all issues revealed throughout the performance of the tests and shall establish internal validation methodologies to\nascertain that all identified weaknesses, deficiencies or gaps are fully addressed.\n6. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure, at least yearly, that appropriate tests are conducted on all\nICT systems and applications supporting critical or important functions.\nArticle 25\nTesting of ICT tools and systems\n1. The digital operational resilience testing programme referred to in Article 24 shall provide, in accordance with the\ncriteria set out in Article 4(2), for the execution of appropriate tests, such as vulnerability assessments and scans, open\nsource analyses, network security assessments, gap analyses, physical security reviews, questionnaires and scanning\nsoftware solutions, source code reviews where feasible, scenario-based tests, compatibility testing, performance testing,\nend-to-end testing and penetration testing.\n2. Central securities depositories and central counterparties shall perform vulnerability assessments before any\ndeployment or redeployment of new or existing applications and infrastructure components, and ICT services supporting\ncritical or important functions of the financial entity.\n3. Microenterprises shall perform the tests referred to in paragraph 1 by combining a risk-based approach with a\nstrategic planning of ICT testing, by duly considering the need to maintain a balanced approach between the scale of\nresources and the time to be allocated to the ICT testing provided for in this Article, on the one hand, and the urgency,\ntype of risk, criticality of information assets and of services provided, as well as any other relevant factor, including the\nfinancial entity’s ability to take calculated risks, on the other hand.\nL 333/46 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.12.2022\nArticle 26\nAdvanced testing of ICT tools, systems and processes based on TLPT\n1. Financial entities, other than entities referred to in Article 16(1), first subparagraph, and other than microenterprises,\nwhich are identified in accordance with paragraph 8, third subparagraph, of this Article, shall carry out at least every 3\nyears advanced testing by means of TLPT. Based on the risk profile of the financial entity and taking into account\noperational circumstances, the competent authority may, where necessary, request the financial entity to reduce or\nincrease this frequency.\n2. Each threat-led penetration test shall cover several or all critical or important functions of a financial entity, and shall\nbe performed on live production systems supporting such functions.\nFinancial entities shall identify all relevant underlying ICT systems, processes and technologies supporting critical or\nimportant functions and ICT services, including those supporting the critical or important functions which have been\noutsourced or contracted to ICT third-party service providers.\nFinancial entities shall assess which critical or important functions need to be covered by the TLPT. The result of this\nassessment shall determine the precise scope of TLPT and shall be validated by the competent authorities.\n3. Where ICT third-party service providers are included in the scope of TLPT, the financial entity shall take the necessary\nmeasures and safeguards to ensure the participation of such ICT third-party service providers in the TLPT and shall retain at\nall times full responsibility for ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\n4. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, first and second subparagraphs, where the participation of an ICT third-party\nservice provider in the TLPT, referred to in paragraph 3, is reasonably expected to have an adverse impact on the quality or\nsecurity of services delivered by the ICT third-party service provider to customers that are entities falling outside the scope\nof this Regulation, or on the confidentiality of the data related to such services, the financial entity and the ICT third-party\nservice provider may agree in writing that the ICT third-party service provider directly enters into contractual arrangements\nwith an external tester, for the purpose of conducting, under the direction of one designated financial entity, a pooled TLPT\ninvolving several financial entities (pooled testing) to which the ICT third-party service provider provides ICT services.\nThat pooled testing shall cover the relevant range of ICT services supporting critical or important functions contracted to\nthe respective ICT third-party service provider by the financial entities. The pooled testing shall be considered TLPT carried\nout by the financial entities participating in the pooled testing.\nThe number of financial entities participating in the pooled testing shall be duly calibrated taking into account the\ncomplexity and types of services involved.\n5. Financial entities shall, with the cooperation of ICT third-party service providers and other parties involved, including\nthe testers but excluding the competent authorities, apply effective risk management controls to mitigate the risks of any\npotential impact on data, damage to assets, and disruption to critical or important functions, services or operations at the\nfinancial entity itself, its counterparts or to the financial sector.\n6. At the end of the testing, after reports and remediation plans have been agreed, the financial entity and, where\napplicable, the external testers shall provide to the authority, designated in accordance with paragraph 9 or 10, a summary\nof the relevant findings, the remediation plans and the documentation demonstrating that the TLPT has been conducted in\naccordance with the requirements.\n7. Authorities shall provide financial entities with an attestation confirming that the test was performed in accordance\nwith the requirements as evidenced in the documentation in order to allow for mutual recognition of threat led\npenetration tests between competent authorities. The financial entity shall notify the relevant competent authority of the\nattestation, the summary of the relevant findings and the remediation plans.\n27.12.2022 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 333/47\nWithout prejudice to such attestation, financial entities shall remain at all times fully responsible for the impact of the tests\nreferred to in paragraph 4.\n8. Financial entities shall contract testers for the purposes of undertaking TLPT in accordance with Article 27. When\nfinancial entities use internal testers for the purposes of undertaking TLPT, they shall contract external testers every three\ntests.\nCredit institutions that are classified as significant in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall\nonly use external testers in accordance with Article 27(1), points (a) to (e).\nCompetent authorities shall identify financial entities that are required to perform TLPT taking into account the criteria set\nout in Article 4(2), based on an assessment of the following:\n(a) impact-related factors, in particular the extent to which the services provided and activities undertaken by the financial\nentity impact the financial sector;\n(b) possible financial stability concerns, including the systemic character of the financial entity at Union or national level,\nas applicable;\n(c) specific ICT risk profile, level of ICT maturity of the financial entity or technology features involved.\n9. Member States may designate a single public authority in the financial sector to be responsible for TLPT-related\nmatters in the financial sector at national level and shall entrust it with all competences and tasks to that effect.\n10. In the absence of a designation in accordance with paragraph 9 of this Article, and without prejudice to the power\nto identify the financial entities that are required to perform TLPT, a competent authority may delegate the exercise of\nsome or all of the tasks referred to in this Article and Article 27 to another national authority in the financial sector.\n11. The ESAs shall, in agreement with the ECB, develop joint draft regulatory technical standards in accordance with the\nTIBER-EU framework in order to specify further:\n(a) the criteria used for the purpose of the application of paragraph 8, second subparagraph;\n(b) the requirements and standards governing the use of internal testers;\n(c) the requirements in relation to:\n(i) the scope of TLPT referred to in paragraph 2;\n(ii) the testing methodology and approach to be followed for each specific phase of the testing process;\n(iii) the results, closure and remediation stages of the testing;\n(d) the type of supervisory and other relevant cooperation which are needed for the implementation of TLPT, and for the\nfacilitation of mutual recognition of that testing, in the context of financial entities that operate in more than one\nMember State, to allow an appropriate level of supervisory involvement and a flexible implementation to cater for\nspecificities of financial sub-sectors or local financial markets.\nWhen developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall give due consideration to any specific feature\narising from the distinct nature of activities across different financial services sectors.\nThe ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 July 2024.\nPower is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards\nreferred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU)\nNo 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\nL 333/48 EN Official Journal of the European Union 27.12.2022\nArticle 27\nRequirements for testers for the carrying out of TLPT\n1. Financial entities shall only use testers for the carrying out of TLPT, that:\n(a) are of the highest suitability and reputability;\n(b) possess technical and organisational capabilities and demonstrate specific expertise in threat intelligence, penetration\ntesting and red team testing;\n(c) are certified by an accreditation body in a Member State or adhere to formal codes of conduct or ethical frameworks;\n(d) provide an independent assurance, or an audit report, in relation to the sound management of risks associated with the\ncarrying out of TLPT, including the due protection of the financial entity’s confidential information and redress for the\nbusiness risks of the financial entity;\n(e) are duly and fully covered by relevant professional indemnity insurances, including against risks of misconduct and\nnegligence.\n2. When using internal testers, financial entities shall ensure that, in addition to the requirements in paragraph 1, the\nfollowing conditions are met:\n(a) such use has been approved by the relevant competent authority or by the single public authority designated in\naccordance with Article 26(9) and (10);\n(b) the relevant competent authority has verified that the financial entity has sufficient dedicated resources and ensured\nthat conflicts of interest are avoided throughout the design and execution phases of the test; and\n(c) the threat intelligence provider is external to the financial entity.\n3. Financial entities shall ensure that contracts concluded with external testers require a sound management of the TLPT\nresults and that any data processing thereof, including any generation, store, aggregation, draft, report, communication or\ndestruction, do not create risks to the financial entity.",
